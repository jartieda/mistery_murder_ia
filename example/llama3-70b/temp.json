            "longbio": "Jack is a self-made millionaire who owns several successful businesses in town. He's known for his sharp mind and ruthless business tactics.",
            "motive": " In the mystery murder game, the motive for Jack, the wealthy businessman, to kill Clara, the strict librarian, could be as follows:\n\nClara had been serving as the head librarian at the town's public library for several decades and was known for her no-nonsense approach to maintaining order and discipline. Jack, who had recently moved to the town, was an avid reader and a frequent visitor to the library. However, he found Clara's strict rules and regulations stifling and her demeanor unapproachable.\n\nOne day, Jack discovered that Clara had been secretly hoarding rare and valuable books in her office, which she had been refusing to make available to the public. As a wealthy book collector, Jack saw an opportunity to acquire these books for his own collection. He approached Clara with an offer to buy the books, but she flatly refused, citing the library's policy of not selling its collections.\n\nIn a fit of anger and frustration, Jack decided to take matters into his own hands. He devised a plan to sneak into the library after hours, locate the rare books, and make them his own. However, when he arrived at the library, he discovered that Clara was still there, working late. In a sudden fit of rage, Jack attacked Clara, killing her in the process.\n\nAfter the murder, Jack quickly located the rare books and escaped with them, leaving the town in shock and grief over the senseless killing of its beloved librarian. The motive for Jack's actions - his desire to acquire the rare books and his anger towards Clara's strict rules - remained a secret until it was eventually uncovered by the game's detectives.",
            "secret": " The secret that Jack knows about the relation of Gracie with Clara is that Gracie was aware of the clandestine love affair between Clara and a married man. This affair was something that Clara wanted to keep secret, but Gracie knew about it and even helped Clara conceal it from the town's gossip. Jack stumbled upon this information, and he suspects that the married man could have been the one who murdered Clara out of guilt or fear of being exposed. However, Jack has no evidence to support this theory, and he knows that Gracie would never reveal Clara's secret, so he keeps it to himself, using it as a piece of information that could potentially help him solve the mystery.",

Jack can confirm this alibi as he remembers seeing Emily at the exhibition until 10:30 PM, and then they parted ways to return to their respective homes. The exhibition was half an hour away from the library, making it impossible for Emily to have committed the murder."

Clara viewed Emily's artistic pursuits as a frivolous waste of time, constantly reprimanding her for bending the rules and breaking the strict codes of conduct that governed the library.\n\nAs Emily's artistic talent began to gain recognition and acclaim, Clara's criticism and disapproval only grew stronger. Emily felt suffocated and misunderstood by Clara's rigid perspective, longing for the freedom to express herself without judgment.\n\nOne fateful day, Emily discovered that Clara had taken it upon herself to purge the library of all \"offensive\" materials, including several rare art books that Emily had been saving up to study. In a fit of rage and desperation, Emily confronted Clara, leading to a heated argument that ultimately ended in tragedy.\n\nNow, as the prime suspect in Clara's murder, Emily must navigate a tangled web of secrets, lies, and motives in order to clear her name and uncover the truth behind the mysterious circumstances surrounding Clara's demise. Will she be able to prove her innocence and expose the real killer, or will she become ensnared in a dangerous game of cat and mouse that puts her own life at risk?",
